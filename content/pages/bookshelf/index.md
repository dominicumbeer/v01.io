In 2023 I aim to post every week a new book recommendation [on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaus-breyer/). This is the summary of them.

## Effective Remote Work: For Yourself, Your Team, and Your Company

[![](remote.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3z5WxqO "Buy it on Amazon")

I had the pleasure of hearing [James Stanier](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/) speak at a conference, and his insights on remote work stuck with me. That's why I highly recommend his book "Effective Remote Work." In it, Stanier argues that remote work without an emphasis on asynchronous work modes is just like working in a physical office, but with all the downsides amplified.

To truly thrive in a remote work environment, we must embrace methods promoting autonomy and allowing for flexible schedules. Stanier's book contains practical tips for making remote work successful and enjoyable, even facing challenges like time zones and communication barriers.

(It is focused on engineers, but my wife also took a lot out of it for their job to digitally transform government work.)

## Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World

[![](range.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3LgttE7 "Buy it on Amazon")

"Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World" holds much personal meaning for me as I have held many diverse responsible positions from a young age. I struggled with not having an explicit professional specialization (like being the Goto-Guru for this or the other thing) for a long time. Still, slowly I am recognizing how much I have benefited from being a generalist and being able to puzzle situations together and drive them forward.

One of the key takeaways from this book is that only through taking action can we truly learn who we are, rather than just thinking about an ideal "should be" future. The author argues that it's about more than just working towards a specific goal but moving forward from promising situations.

I highly recommend "Range" to anyone grappling with the idea of being a generalist in a specialized world. It's a refreshing and inspiring read that challenges conventional thinking about career paths and success

## The Zen of Steve Jobs

[![](jobs.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3ZChPaM "Buy it on Amazon")

It tells not only the story of Steve Jobs, but also his connection to Buddhism and explains some of his values that still influence the products we all use today.

## Thinking in Systems: A Primer

[![](systems.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3lZmQf0 "Buy it on Amazon")

My book recommendation for this week is about System Thinking.
Why is it relevant? Feedback loops are everywhere. --> It's not about who is at fault. It's about understanding the system.
Dynamic systems cannot be understood via statistical correlations. (This can only ever be used to map the past but cannot produce strong statements about the future. )
Systems cannot be mastered or wholly understood. -> You have to ""dance"" with them, and you can shape your sphere of influence correctly.

In the end, there is no single truth. On the one hand, the world is not linear, but on the other hand, system boundaries are also messy.

## Are Your Lights On?: How to Figure Out What the Problem Really is

[![](lights-on.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3Xn9g1Y "Buy it on Amazon")

Solving a problem is easy. The hard part is about figuring out / defining the problem!
In this "problem-space" (pun intended) is my recent book recommendation (from 1990 - but its wisdom is not old.)

It is about working with problems. Because in the end, that is what we all do, day in and day out, when hacking code, developing products for customers, or managing people.

Favorite Takeaways:
- If you can't think of at least three things that might be wrong with your understanding of the problem, you need help understanding the problem.
- Each solution is the source of the next problem.
- The source of the problem is most often within you.

## The Dip: The extraordinary benefits of knowing when to quit (and when to stick)

[![](dip.png#small)](https://amzn.to/40uteL1 "Buy it on Amazon")
A little book by Seth Godin (I love short, concise books, by the way!).

Well, the title says it all. In the book, Seth introduces the concept of a "dip" that everyone goes through in their creative/entrepreneurial endeavor. The difficulty is recognizing whether you are in a dip or a hopeless situation.

Besides that, my most important takeaway is: The opposite of "to stop" is not "to wait."

## Learning to Build: The 5 Bedrock Skills of Innovators and Entrepreneurs

[![](learning-build.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3lJ6Nll "Buy it on Amazon")

It is about: empathic perspective, uncovering demand, causal structures, prototyping to learn, and making trade-offs.

Every single one of those topics is probably not a news flash - but they were completely redefined for me through this book.

For example: When he talks about prototyping, he does not think of a/b tests - he rather thinks of building an orthogonal array of experiments to test all possible variations of a problem at once!
This is something completely different, then "iterating" on a product.

The same goes for the other 4 topics. There is a lot to unpack behind those words and a lot of wisdom in this book.

## Demand-Side Sales 101: Stop Selling and Help Your Customers Make Progress

[![](demand-sales.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3kIZj0V "Buy it on Amazon")

The title says "Sales," but I am not a Sales Person, and everybody knows this. But it is about much more. Ultimately, the book discusses the empathetic development of businesses and business models. It comes with intelligent models and processes that are more customer-centric than anything I have ever encountered elsewhere.
