In 2023 I aim to post every week a new book recommendation [on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaus-breyer/). This is the summary of them.

## The Zen of Steve Jobs

It tells not only the story of Steve Jobs, but also his connection to Buddhism and explains some of his values that still influence the products we all use today.
## Thinking in Systems: A Primer

My book recommendation for this week is about System Thinking.
Why is it relevant? Feedback loops are everywhere. --> It's not about who is at fault. It's about understanding the system.
Dynamic systems cannot be understood via statistical correlations. (This can only ever be used to map the past but cannot produce strong statements about the future. )
Systems cannot be mastered or wholly understood. -> You have to ""dance"" with them, and you can shape your sphere of influence correctly.

In the end, there is no single truth. On the one hand, the world is not linear, but on the other hand, system boundaries are also messy.

## Are Your Lights On?: How to Figure Out What the Problem Really is

Solving a problem is easy. The hard part is about figuring out / defining the problem!
In this "problem-space" (pun intended) is my recent book recommendation (from 1990 - but its wisdom is not old.)

It is about working with problems. Because in the end, that is what we all do, day in and day out, when hacking code, developing products for customers, or managing people.

Favorite Takeaways:
- If you can't think of at least three things that might be wrong with your understanding of the problem, you need help understanding the problem.
- Each solution is the source of the next problem.
- The source of the problem is most often within you.

## The Dip: The extraordinary benefits of knowing when to quit (and when to stick)

[![](dip.png#small)](https://amzn.to/40uteL1 "Buy it on Amazon")
A little book by Seth Godin (I love short, concise books, by the way!).

Well, the title says it all. In the book, Seth introduces the concept of a "dip" that everyone goes through in their creative/entrepreneurial endeavor. The difficulty is recognizing whether you are in a dip or a hopeless situation.

Besides that, my most important takeaway is: The opposite of "to stop" is not "to wait."

## Learning to Build: The 5 Bedrock Skills of Innovators and Entrepreneurs

[![](learning-build.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3lJ6Nll "Buy it on Amazon")

It is about: empathic perspective, uncovering demand, causal structures, prototyping to learn, and making trade-offs.

Every single one of those topics is probably not a news flash - but they were completely redefined for me through this book.

For example: When he talks about prototyping, he does not think of a/b tests - he rather thinks of building an orthogonal array of experiments to test all possible variations of a problem at once!
This is something completely different, then "iterating" on a product.

The same goes for the other 4 topics. There is a lot to unpack behind those words and a lot of wisdom in this book.

## Demand-Side Sales 101: Stop Selling and Help Your Customers Make Progress

[![](demand-sales.png#small)](https://amzn.to/3kIZj0V "Buy it on Amazon")

The title says "Sales," but I am not a Sales Person, and everybody knows this. But it is about much more. Ultimately, the book discusses the empathetic development of businesses and business models. It comes with intelligent models and processes that are more customer-centric than anything I have ever encountered elsewhere.
