As a highly experienced consultant and CTO, I excel at providing strategic guidance and technical expertise to help businesses achieve their goals. With a focus on prototyping foundations that optimize through iterative improvement and close collaboration with management, I have a proven track record of success in building and refining products and business models.

My scopes of work include:

1. Development of the technical vision and pitch it to investors and stakeholders.
1. Building a product's first version and initial architecture by myself, if necessary.
1. Staffing the team, onboarding the team members, and ensuring they can work happily and productively in a modern development environment.
1. Owning the process that optimizes the (technical) processes: Up to product engineering org.
1. Finding a successor and handing over the team to someone permanent at a certain point.

Whether you're an agency, SME, or startup, I can help you achieve your goals by providing a range of services that are tailored to your specific needs. My ultimate goal is to establish a strong social connection with the non-technical parts of the company, ensuring that everyone is aligned and working towards a shared vision of success.

## Now: what am I currently doing?

### 2019 – Now [Ray Sono AG][2]: Tech Lead for IIot business unit & Technology Principal (freelance)

As a Technology Principal, I am involved in projects from the initial conceptual brainstorming stage to the eventual implementation, using either internal or external resources. In larger projects, I take on the role of Tech Lead, overseeing a development team. I perform these duties on-site with the Berlin team or remotely with an international team of developers.

As the Technical Lead at [Hydro Pocket](https://hydropocket.com/), the first end-customer product of the industrial company GmbH & Co. KGaA, I built the tech team from scratch within this new business unit and introduced the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) method. Hydro Pocket is a leading provider of solutions for hydropower plants. It offers innovative technologies to prevent outages and optimize the performance of hydropower plants through actionable real-time data.

## Past: What have I already done?

Here are some of the highlights of my 12year+ track record. But that is not all. Many more, primarily minor projects, are not mentioned here.

### 2010 – 2015 [buddybrand GmbH][3]: Founder and managing technical director – digital agency

Right out of university, I started building Facebook apps as a freelancer with my co-founders – just at the right time. Even before I could hand in my bachelor thesis, we had earned enough money to start a GmbH. In the next 3 years alone, we built several hundred Facebook apps and grew from cash flow to 30+ employees. Nowadays, buddybrand is a full-service digital creative agency these days.

(bootstrapped, 40 FTE)

### 2016 – 2018 [BuzzBird GmbH][4]: Founder and Chief Technology & Product Officer – Influencer Marketplace

We embarked on an exciting journey with the goal of making social media influencers programmatically bookable - similar to Google Ads. This challenge sparked innovation, leading to the development of sophisticated software, which is now primarily used internally. This software effectively digitalizes the influencer process, acting as an "Influencer Agency on Steroids."

Key features of our system include a billing system, a matching algorithm, and an influencer inventory management module. Furthermore, it encourages transparency and data-driven decisions by enabling social media creators to share their statistics.

(venture-backed, 25 FTE)

### 2018 – 2019 Fotando GmbH: Founder and Chief Prototyping Officer – E-commerce

We had noticed that most photo printing vendors always send their customers to ugly, bloated, slow native apps, which in turn also always had ugly ad conversions as they sent users to the AppStore. So the challenge was clear: we need a customer journey where the user can upload, crop, and edit their photo in the mobile browser and then (after delivery) hang it on the wall (claim: from hand to the wall!). Technically, it worked great that way, too. However, at that time, the company slid into the first Corona wave shortly before it was financed. In retrospect: Pretty stupid – for all parties.

### 2016 – 2019 [Native Studios UG][5]: Technical Evangelist – SaaS

I built [several iterations of a prototype]({{< relref path="2016-case-study-creace-prototyping-process-of-a-react-native-mobile-app-from-proof-to-release">}}) for the founders in 2016 and 2017 until they could convince backers and first customers with it.

Afterward, I was Tech Lead for product development and Technical Evangelist to convince customers of the startup’s technology and capabilities.
