Hello, I'm Klaus Breyer, a technology leader with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and over a decade of experience in building and managing effective teams. Holding a degree in **Software Engineering**, I successfully founded my first startup in 2010, subsequently lending my expertise as CTO or CPTO to several other companies.

I strongly advocate [Shape Up]({{< ref "shape-up" >}}), a fresh approach to agile software development, and am committed to nurturing robust technical and organizational infrastructures that inspire teams to excel. In a rapidly evolving technology landscape, I constantly seek to foster innovation and maintain a competitive edge.

As a seasoned CTO, I provide strategic direction and technical know-how to help businesses meet their objectives. My focus lies in laying strong prototyping foundations through iterative improvement and close collaboration with management.

I thrive at the nexus of tech, product, and business, with core competencies including:

1. Crafting and presenting the technical vision to investors and stakeholders.
1. Independently building the initial version and architecture of a product, if required.
1. Building, onboarding, and creating a conducive environment for a productive development team.
1. Streamlining technical processes up to the level of product engineering.

If you need a proactive, outcome-oriented leader to propel your company's technical strategy and incorporate the benefits of Shape Up, I welcome the opportunity to explore how I can contribute to your success.

## My Manifest

> Good software is always used but never finished.

Thats all.

## Founding & Management Experience

Throughout my career, I've led the development and launch of numerous cutting-edge projects in **modern web stacks**, ranging from fast-moving startups to complex microservice environments. I pride myself on my ability to balance technical excellence with a strategic vision, enabling my teams to focus on solving problems that truly matter and delivering value to users.

### 2019 – Now [Ray Sono AG][2]: Technology Principal & Tech Lead for IIot products (freelance)

Ray Sono is a digital product development agency. Working with Ray Sono, I especially like strategic understanding and user-centric thinking. As a Technology Principal, I am involved in projects from the initial conceptual brainstorming to the eventual implementation (with internal or external resources). In larger projects, I lead a development team as Tech Lead. I do this on-site with the Berlin team or remotely with an international team of developers.

As Technical Lead at [Hydro Pocket](https://hydropocket.com/), the first end-customer product of the industrial company Voith, I built up the team from scratch and introduced the [Shape Up]({{< ref "shape-up" >}}) method. Hydro Pocket is a leading provider of solutions for hydropower plants, offering innovative technologies to prevent outages and optimize the performance of hydropower plants through actionable real-time data.

### 2018 – 2019 Fotando GmbH : Founder and Chief Prototyping Officer – E-commerce

We had noticed that most photo printing vendors always send their customers to ugly, bloated, slow native apps, which in turn also always had ugly ad conversions as they sent users to the AppStore. So the challenge was clear: we need a customer journey where the user can upload, crop, and edit their photo in the mobile browser and then (after delivery) hang it on the wall (claim: from hand to the wall!). Technically, it worked great that way, too. However, at that time, the company slid into the first Corona wave shortly before it was financed. In retrospect: Pretty stupid – for all parties.

### 2016 – 2018 [BuzzBird GmbH][4]: Founder and Chief Technology & Product Officer – Influencer Marketplace

We started with the goal of making social media influencers bookable programmatically – like Google Ads. However, we underestimated how many sensitivities and non-deterministic requirements are imposed by both Supply and Demand. Now the developed software is mainly used internally to map the influencer process smoothly and fully digitized – an “Influencer Agency on Steroids.”

(venture-backed, 25 FTE)

### 2010 – 2015 [buddybrand GmbH][3]: Founder and managing technical director – digital agency

Right out of university, I started building Facebook apps as a freelancer with my co-founders – just at the right time. Even before I could hand in my bachelor thesis, we had earned enough money to start a GmbH. In the next 3 years alone, we built several hundred Facebook apps and grew from cash flow to 30+ employees. Nowadays, buddybrand is a full-service digital creative agency these days.

(bootstrapped, 40 FTE)

## Consulting, Advisory & Side Projects

In addition to my professional experience, I'm also a dedicated entrepreneur and startup investor. I develop and market [projects]({{< ref "/categories/unixtime.app" >}}) on the side and support early-stage companies through a small fund. I'm also committed to giving back to the [open-source]({{< ref "/categories/open-source" >}}) community and have contributed to several projects.

### 2022 – 2023 [unixtime.app](https://www.unixtime.app): Bulk timestamp conversion for API developer workflows

A tool designed for API developers to facilitate bulk timestamp conversion. The idea was born out of my work as a Tech Lead in an IIoT microservice context where data, coded as Unix timestamps, was plentiful. I sought to streamline my workflow, crafting a tool that let me bypass the laborious task of individually selecting timestamps for conversion in external services. Now, I can simply copy entire API requests into unixtime.app and view all timestamps directly within their context. The tool also allows me to capture screenshots of the conversions, useful for sharing in collaborative spaces like Slack or JIRA. What started as a straightforward HTML file has evolved into a full-fledged application for Mac and Windows and is now open source.

### 2021 – 2023 [Fillter][6]: Personal inbound assistant for social media creators

Fillter is a form for all social media creator requests. They link Fillter in their link tree, Instagram bio, or website. Through a unique questioning technique, the requests come as usual via email – only in good.

The tool is a joint venture with [Felix and Oğuz][7]. We all work hands-on as equal cofounders, with our individual skills, to bring the project to the world.

### 2019 – Now [touch361][8]: Business intelligence software for marketing touchpoint analysis

I am a technical sparring partner for founders with marketing and business intelligence as their focus. The challenges we tackle here focus on data protection / DSGVO and the product development process with the technical service provider.

### 2018 – Now [vitalfunktion GmbH][9]: Pharma tech startup with B2C and B2B apps for medication intolerances

The startup’s main product is a really smooth-to-use app for medication intolerances. I am sparring with the founder Maximilian (pharmacist), weekly for product development and monetization. Currently, we have a solid number of several thousand MAU (Monthly Active Users) and refinance the app through fixed advertising cooperations in the pharmaceutical industry.

In addition, there is also a B2B variant (planned initially as a pivot) aimed at doctors and pharmacists. I developed the prototype in Material UI and still maintain the product today.

### 2016 – 2019 [Native Studios UG][5]: Technical Evangelist – SaaS

I built [several iterations of a prototype]({{< relref path="2016-case-study-creace-prototyping-process-of-a-react-native-mobile-app-from-proof-to-release">}}) for the founders in 2016 and 2017 until they could convince backers and first customers with it.

Afterward, I was Tech Lead for product development and Technical Evangelist to convince customers of the startup’s technology and capabilities.

## Appearances

As an [accomplished writer]({{< relref path="2015-practical-guide-facebook-development" >}}) and [public speaker]({{< ref "/pages/appearances" >}}), I'm always eager to share my insights and expertise with others. In addition to my own book, I've written numerous guest articles for top blogs and am a frequent conference speaker, comfortable addressing audiences of all sizes and backgrounds.
