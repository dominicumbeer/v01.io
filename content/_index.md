## Decade in Tech

I'm Klaus Breyer. With [a lifetime in tech]({{< relref "/pages/cv" >}}), a degree in _Software Engineering_, and a passion for innovation, I went from founding my first startup in 2010 to playing key roles as _CTO/CTPO_ in many others.

## Shape Up

I'm all in on [Shape Up]({{< relref "/tags/shapeup/" >}}) - Agile's got a new face, and it's thrilling: _Fixed time, variable scope_. The only way to deliver quality - on time.

It is all about the people: Developers, designers, product managers – all on the same page, sculpting ideas into reality.

Want to spar about it? I offer free 1-hour sessions. Need a deep dive? I'm here for hands-on guidance.

## Modern Web Stacks & Leadership

From startup _monoliths_ to large _microservice_ environments, I've led and launched.

But beyond the tech, I build infrastructures that empower.

Teams that innovate.

Projects that matter.

## Proven Impact and Expertise

What do I bring to the table? Strategy and technical prowess. It’s not about coding; it’s about laying the foundation for products that make a mark. And doing it in sync with the business side of things.

1. _Startup strategy_ – turning ideas into impactful ventures.
1. Selling the _tech vision_ – whether it's to investors or stakeholders.
1. _Prototyping & Crafting_ the first version of a product from scratch, if need be.
1. Assembling and nurturing _a killer team_.
1. Bringing _product & engineering processes_ up to speed.

## Writer & Speaker

I've penned down my thoughts in [articles]({{< ref "/posts/">}}) and shared them out loud at [conferences]({{< relref "appearances">}}). Whether it's a page or a stage, I'm there.

## My v0.1 Manifest

> Good software is always used but never finished.

That's it.

## Connect with Me

Tech, product, business – that's where I thrive.

More than code, it's about weaving the tech fabric into the company's culture.

For agencies, SME or fledgling startups.
