summary: I have been responsible for technology and teams since I founded my first startup in 2010, right after graduating in Software Engineering. Since then, I have been actively or consultatively involved in several other companies as CTO and CPO. I have built, managed, and launched many individual technical projects in (a constantly changing) modern web stack: From fast-moving independent startup projects to brownfield microservice environments.

# Welcome

Hello! I'm Klaus Breyer, a seasoned technology leader with over a decade of experience in building and managing high-performing teams. With a degree in **Software Engineering** and a passion for innovation, I founded my first startup in 2010 and have since played a pivotal role in the success of several other companies as their CTO and CPO.

In addition to my professional experience, I'm also a dedicated entrepreneur and startup investor. I develop and market [projects]({{< ref "/categories/unixtime.app" >}}) on the side and support early-stage companies through a small fund. I'm also committed to giving back to the [open-source]({{< ref "/categories/open-source" >}}) community and have contributed to several projects.

As an [accomplished writer]({{< relref path="praxishandbuch-facebook-entwicklung" lang="de" >}}) and [public speaker]({{< ref "/pages/appearances" >}}), I'm always eager to share my insights and expertise with others. In addition to my own book, I've written numerous guest articles for top blogs and am a frequent conference speaker, comfortable addressing audiences of all sizes and backgrounds.

I'm also a big believer in [Shape Up]({{< ref "shape-up" >}}), an up-and-coming method for agile software development. I offer free 1-hour sparring sessions around this topic or paid hands-on help to implement the method in organizations of various sizes.

Throughout my career, I've led the development and launch of numerous cutting-edge projects in **modern web stacks**, ranging from fast-moving startups to complex microservice environments. I pride myself on my ability to balance technical excellence with a strategic vision, enabling my teams to focus on solving problems that truly matter and delivering value to users.

At the heart of my leadership philosophy is a commitment to building **strong technical and organizational infrastructures** that empower individuals to do their best work. Whether consulting or leading internal teams, I'm always looking for ways to nurture innovation and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.

If you're looking for a dynamic, results-driven leader who can help drive your company's technical strategy forward and bring the benefits of Shape Up to your organization, [I'd love to connect and explore how I can contribute to your success]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}).
