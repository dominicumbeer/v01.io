Today I released v4.0.3 of unixtime.app.

It is a little unusual version jump from 0.3 to 4.0.3. But this was caused because of the Microsoft Partner Portal requiring a version of 1.0.0 or larger. (Yes, I am preparing the windows version right now!)

So I decided to not increment from 0.3 -> 0.4 but instead to 4.0.0. The move from 4.0.0 -> 4.0.3 WAS caused by minor updates during normal development.

Changelog:

- synchronous scrolling
- new setting elements


Also, I created a page with the background story, of why I created this app.
