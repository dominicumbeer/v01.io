Today I released v4.0.6 of the unixtime.app and prepared a little bit for a round of activation I want to do next week in my closest community circles.

Changelog:

- Optimized PWA caching strategy
- Improved Settings styling
- Under the hood:
- [parcel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel) as a building tool for the web versions
- [Utilizing posthtml](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml) to avoid duplication for the additional website sites.
